* Color and Width *
*******************
- Use the Color Picker to change the active drawing color.
- The width slider (or numeric input) sets the current stroke thickness.
- Tools automatically receive updates when color or width changes.

*******************
*      Tips       *
*******************
- Always pick your color *before* starting a stroke.
  (Colors update live, but strokes only use the color at the moment
  drawing commands are executed.)
- Experiment with different widths for more expressive strokes.
- Switching tools keeps your last used color and width.
