# Pain(t)

**Pain(t)** is a JavaFX-based paint application inspired by Minecraft Forge-style event handling.
It provides a flexible canvas environment for image editing, file I/O, and experimentation with
custom workspaces.

## Overview

Pain(t) is built with JavaFX and emphasizes a clean, modular architecture.
By leveraging an internal event bus, the application decouples UI interactions from backend logic,
making it easy to extend and maintain.
