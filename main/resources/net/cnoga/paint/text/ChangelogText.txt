Chris' Pain(t) 6.0.0 - 10/7/2025

"The Great Rotate Update"

# New Features:
* 90 degree rotations of the canvas / selection
* Horizontal + Vertical Mirroring of the canvas. (selection NYI)
* Autosave Notifications from the OS when the autosave triggers.
* Tooltips for all buttons
* N-Sided Star
* Threaded logging using log4j (version 2.3.2, which is safe from the RCE vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) )

# Known Issues:
- Rotations of selections leaves what was there already. Not intentional.

# Polish Round Hopes
- Theme (Dark/Light/User Defined?) support
- Tight coupling of the selection stuff.
- A review of what really needs to be an Event.
  - I'm hoping to cut down on a few things that *really* shouldn't be events. There are quite a lot.
- Zoom/UI overhaul
  - Arbitrary panning of viewport for better drawing experience.
  - Finally centering the canvas. I really really really hate how it's just sitting there in the top left.
- Persistent user settings.
  - I.e. which subwindows (tools, layers) to have open.
- Layer system
- Arbitrary angle rotations for selection.
  - This is an example of Affine-Based things...
- Panning and selection are blurry. This is because the GraphicsContext tries to screenshot everything and compress it.
  - I will likely try to first disable this via GraphicsContext2D#setImageSmoothing(false)
  - But more likely than not I may have to roll with a straight PixelReader/Writer.

"The Server and Save Update"

# New Features:
- Added unit testing for the event bus to ensure that nothing about it changes
- Added a webserver to present one or more of the images as selected by the user.
- Added the ability to save in an alternative file format than the one that was the original for the image.
- Added a warning image features/data loss can happen when saving to lossy formats.
- Added a timer that allows for autosave, which can be toggled on and off in the settings menu.

# Known Issues:
- The autosave isn't done on the main javaFX thread- so I have to do a bunch of annoying Platform.runlater() BS to get
  it to work. I don't like this..?

"The Real Paint Program Update"

# New Features:
- Undo/Redo Functionality
- Select and move a piece of the image
- Copy and paste selections
- Added more shapes: N-sided polygon, right triangle, donut
- Text Tool
- Clear Canvas Dialog

# Known Issues:
- [CRITICAL] Selection mutations happen across tabs.
- [CRITICAL] Undo/Redo calls happen across tabs.
This is because of sloppy event bus configuration. Each workspace has its own "SelectionCapability"
and "UndoRedoCapability", but the events they listen to are not unique. This will be fixed next sprint--
I've other things to worry about right now.

# Next Sprint Hopes
- Fixing the critical issues
- Unit Testing
- Auto-Save
- Webserver

Chris' Pain(t) 3.0.0 - 9/12/2025

"The Brews, Shapes, and Tabs Update"

# New Features:
- The shape tool, which is currently able to draw a Square, Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, and Pentagon.
- Line previews for the line drawing tool. You can now see what you're doing!
- Multiple workspace support (Tabs!), where each workspace is aware of its own save state before it is closed.
- The eraser tool with true transparency.
- The dropper tool which takes the color from the canvas and shows nice
- Renamed all "Services" to "Brews" to ensure maximum Java punniness.
- Added Keith
- Less swear words

# Known Issues:
- There is a small hiccup in closing the entire program where tabs that need to be saved can still be closed even if they aren't saved.
- Zooming is still stupid. Saving this for the UI-focused sprint.
- I will also try to center the canvas for that sprint.
- I want to also mess around with tightening some of the event bus driven architecture (i.e. making some names clearer), but this isn't top priority.

# Next Sprint Hopes
- Undo & Redo
- Scale Canvas
- Selection
- Text

"The Tool Update"

# New Features:
- Added JPG BMP and PNG support to all IO operations
- Line, Paintbrush, and Pan tool
  - Customizable Line Widths
  - Customizable Color via Color Chooser
- The ability to manage an image larger than the window and the screen. Done via zooming
- Added a help menu with documentation, help, this changelog, and a GitHub link.
- Smart Save.
- Canvas resizing for larger drawings.

# Known Issues:
- Zooming is clunky and awkward.
- Save As from one image is rather stupid. Doesn't work very well. I think it's an issue with storing the file and not clearing it for the next save.

# Next Sprint Hopes
- Multiple images in different tabs
- Keybinds for tools and capabilities
- Shapes with solid fill and outline fill. Make the shapes resizable when drawing. Give them
  little grabber things that allow for resizing. (last part NYI)
