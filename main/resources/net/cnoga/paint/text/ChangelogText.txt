Chris' Pain(t) 2.0.0 - 9/5/2025

"The Tool Update"

# New Features:
- Added JPG BMP and PNG support to all IO operations
- Line, Paintbrush, and Pan tool
  - Customizable Line Widths
  - Customizable Color via Color Chooser
- The ability to manage an image larger than the window and the screen. Done via zooming
- Added a help menu with documentation, help, this changelog, and a GitHub link.
- Smart Save.
- Canvas resizing for larger drawings.

# Known Issues:
- Zooming is clunky and awkward.
- Save As from one image is rather stupid. Doesn't work very well. I think it's an issue with
  storing the file and not clearing it for the next save.

# Next Sprint Hopes
- Multiple images in different tabs
- Keybinds for tools and capabilities
- Shapes with solid fill and outline fill. Make the shapes resizable when drawing. Give them
  little grabber things that allow for
