Chris' Pain(t) 3.0.0 - 9/12/2025

"The Brews, Shapes, and Tabs Update"

# New Features:
- The shape tool, which is currently able to draw a Square, Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, and Pentagon.
- Line previews for the line drawing tool. You can now see what you're doing!
- Multiple workspace support (Tabs!), where each workspace is aware of its own save state before it is closed.
- The eraser tool with true transparency.
- The dropper tool which takes the color from the canvas and shows nice
- Renamed all "Services" to "Brews" to ensure maximum Java punniness.
- Added Keith
- Less swear words

# Known Issues:
- There is a small hiccup in closing the entire program where tabs that need to be saved can still be closed even if they aren't saved.
- Zooming is still stupid. Saving this for the UI-focused sprint.
- I will also try to center the canvas for that sprint.
- I want to also mess around with tightening some of the event bus driven architecture (i.e. making some names clearer), but this isn't top priority.

# Next Sprint Hopes
- Undo & Redo
- Scale Canvas
- Selection
- Text

"The Tool Update"

# New Features:
- Added JPG BMP and PNG support to all IO operations
- Line, Paintbrush, and Pan tool
  - Customizable Line Widths
  - Customizable Color via Color Chooser
- The ability to manage an image larger than the window and the screen. Done via zooming
- Added a help menu with documentation, help, this changelog, and a GitHub link.
- Smart Save.
- Canvas resizing for larger drawings.

# Known Issues:
- Zooming is clunky and awkward.
- Save As from one image is rather stupid. Doesn't work very well. I think it's an issue with storing the file and not clearing it for the next save.

# Next Sprint Hopes
- Multiple images in different tabs
- Keybinds for tools and capabilities
- Shapes with solid fill and outline fill. Make the shapes resizable when drawing. Give them
  little grabber things that allow for resizing. (last part NYI)
