*      Tips       *
*******************
- Always pick your color *before* starting a stroke.
  (Colors update live, but strokes only use the color at the moment
  drawing commands are executed.)
- Experiment with different widths for more expressive strokes.
- Switching tools keeps your last used color and width.
